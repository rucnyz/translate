      "On 10 December 1982, the General Assembly adopted resolution 37/90 in which it endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.\n",
      "In that resolution, the Assembly decided, inter alia, that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should disseminate, through panel meetings and seminars, information on new and advanced technology and applications, with emphasis on their relevance and implications for developing countries.\n",
      "The United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Applications of Space Techniques to Prevent and Combat Natural Disasters was one of the activities of the Programme for 1995 that were endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994.\n",
      "The Workshop was organized in cooperation with the Government of Zimbabwe.\n",
      "It was hosted by the Environment and Remote Sensing Institute (ERSI) and held at Harare, from 22 to 26 May 1995, for participants from developing countries of the region covered by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).\n",
      "The objectives of the Workshop were (a) to expose the participants, particularly managers of emergency response agencies, to ways and means of utilizing space technology (remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite communications, positioning by satellites) to prevent or mitigate the effects of natural disasters; and (b) to address the development of databases and their use with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prevent disasters or to monitor, mitigate and redress the effects of disasters when they occur.\n",
      "The presentations to the Workshop covered the use of remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite positioning systems and satellite communications and how they could be used, separately or collectively, to prevent disasters or to forecast, monitor and mitigate the effects of severe weather phenomena, such as flooding, desertification and drought.\n",
      "The presentations also addressed the extent to which the same technologies could mitigate the effects of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n",
      "The Workshop concluded with discussions on the needs of the emergency response services, the capabilities of space technology to satisfy those needs and the actions that would be necessary in the short- and medium-term to take advantage of those capabilities.\n",
      "The participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries.\n",
      "B. Organization and programme of the Workshop The participants were professionals with several years experience in managerial positions with national and regional emergency response agencies and services.\n",
      "Other participants had several years experience in remote sensing, satellite meteorology and the use of databases such as GIS.\n",
      "Sixty-nine experts from 18 States Members of the United Nations and eight international and regional organizations participated in the Workshop; 44 participants represented 14 developing countries from the ECA region.\n",
      "The Workshop was attended by participants from the following countries and international organizations: Benin, Botswana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n",
      "Presentations were made by experts from Ghana, France, Japan, Norway, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America and Zimbabwe; from European Space Agency (ESA), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (regional delegation for Southern Africa), International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations/International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (UNDHA/IDNDR), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, as well as by a representative of the Globalstar satellite communications company.\n",
      "Funds allocated by the United Nations and ESA were used to defray the air travel and per diem expenses of 14 participants from 11 developing countries of the ECA region.\n",
      "The Government of Zimbabwe, through ERSI, provided the conference facilities and the Government also provided local transportation for all participants in the Workshop.\n",
      "The programme of the Workshop (annex I), was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA.\n",
      "The Workshop held plenary and working group meetings.\n",
      "At the latter, the participants discussed the issues related to the use of space technologies to prevent and combat the effects of natural disasters.\n",
      "The working papers of these groups are given in annexes II-V.\n",
      "A. Observations of the Workshop The critical factors that distinguish natural phenomena from natural disasters are loss of life and property.\n",
      "Certainly, humans cannot prevent the occurrence of natural phenomena such as typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n",
      "Their disastrous effects, however, can be lessened significantly if well-conceived disaster-response plans and mitigation strategies are in place prior to their occurrence.\n",
      "The Workshop noted that developing countries were particularly subject to natural disasters on a scale that overwhelmed the capacity of the societies concerned to cope with their aftermath.\n",
      "In many cases, just one such destructive episode was sufficient to destroy the social and economic infrastructure, including the communications network.\n",
      "A single major disaster could disrupt the distribution of food and water supplies, medical services, and both the local and international communication links of the stricken communities.\n"
